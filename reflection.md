Latin 101 reflection

Out of all the times we discussed the intersection of Latin and structures of power, our class discussion during the scholar strike stood out to me. Before, I had never considered the role that language played in racial injustice. I knew that generally only wealthier citizens, who had access to higher education could learn Latin. But, I never knew that people used Latin to justify racial injustice.

During the scholar strike, we discussed how some Americans used Latin as a justification for slavery. In the mid 19th century, one man said he would believe that blacks were equal to whites when he met an African-American who studied Classics. While it is not shocking that some Americans in the mid 19th century were trying to justify slavery, I had never considered that someone would use the inability to understand Classics as a justification for slavery. Sadly, most African-Americans at this time did not have the opportunity to study Classics. Some were slaves and even those who were free could not afford to go to college and study Classics.

Today the study of Latin is not used to justify slavery. But, it is still difficult for students of color to study Classics because of financial barriers that limit everyone from having the same opportunity to learn the language. Generally, one can only take a Latin or Classics class at a private high school or college. Many student’s families cannot afford to send their children to a private high school or college. As in the past, many African-Americans do not have the opportunity to study Classics. But today, it is because they are from a low-income family not because they are a slave. This shows that studying Latin is still a luxury that is only available to students from wealthier backgrounds.

Historically there has always been a barrier for entry to learn Latin. There has been a racial barrier as well as a financial one. It is disappointing that not everyone has the opportunity to learn Latin since it can help improve one’s understanding of English while also allowing them to read ancient texts. I hope that next semester we can teach the children from the Worcester public schools Latin since they will be able to learn a new language. Growing up, it would have helped me out to learn a language like Latin, so hopefully, it will help them too.
