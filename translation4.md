Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

When the Greaks could not seize troy for ten years, Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size.
In it Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus were gathered.
And on the horse they wrote, "The greeks offer this gift to Minerva", and they carried over their military camps to Tenedos.
When the trojans saw it, they judged the enemies had gone away; Prium commanded the horse to be led into the temple of Minerva.
When the prophet, Cassandra, said the horse had the enemies, faith was not given to her and the horse was placed in front of the temple.
The greeks exited and killed the guards of the gate and Troy was conquered.
