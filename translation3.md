C. Translation

Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

Erechtheus, the son of Pandīonis, had four daughters.

At that time, Eumolpus, son of Nepune, came to attack Athēns, but he was defeated.

Neptūnus, angry because his son was killed by Erechtheus, said "a daughter of Erechtheus must be sacrificed."

So Chthonia, one of the daughters, was sacrificed.

The other sisters killed themselves, Erechtheus himself was hit by lightning.
